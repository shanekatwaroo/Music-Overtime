# Music-Overtime


With a constantly evolving world, every generation brings something different to the table, furthering our development as humans. One such development includes the progression of music throughout time. Despite younger generations sharing various interests with older generations, music tends to be a topic that changes and evolves every single year. This can range from aspects such as changes in instrumentalness, duration, tempo, and many more. This topic seemed very interesting, being that it is difficult to visualize the progression of such concepts.

The datasets used for this project include the audio attributes for 600+ songs ranked on the
Billboard Top 100 list for each decade. These decades include the 1950’s, 1960’s, 1970’s, 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000-2009. Aspects such as ‘danceability’ and ‘acousticness’ are present, and are rated on a scale of 0.0-1.0. This can help to visualize these concepts when they are displayed on a graph.
