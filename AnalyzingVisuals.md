# Genre Prominence

- As you can see, there are several takeaways we can get from this graph:
- The Rock genre has been the most impactful throughout the past five decades. However, it is clear that the number of rock songs hitting the top charts are declining.
- Pop music is quickly progressing and has been the most listened-to genre in the past two decades.
- The 2000’s introduced a sharp incline in the amount of hip-hop songs hitting the top 100 billboards.

# Instrument Usage

Moving on, a topic that seemed interesting to me is the use of instruments in music through the decades. Although an instrument is classified as a device or object used to produce musical notes and sounds, devices that use electronics to simulate musical sounds(i.e computers) will not be counted as instruments.
- Key takeaways:
- In the 1950’s, bands utilized instruments the most in order to create music. This is mostly due to the fact that at that time, there was no way to imitate musical sounds on machines. Thus, playing instruments was the only true way to create musical sounds.
- As technology progressed, the use of instruments decreased more and more, being that it is much easier to simulate these sounds rather than learning an instrument.
- When comparing this data to the previous graph, it can be noted that as genres such as rock and jazz (which rely on instruments) decreased in popularity, the overall use of instruments in music decreased as well.
- The sharp incline between the 1990’s and 2000’s could possibly be justified by the increase in popularity of pop music, which can include instruments as well.

# Progression of Energy and Danceability in Music
Energy refers to how energetic a song is, taking into account its loudness and upbeat nature. Danceability refers to how suitable a song is for dancing. For instance, songs with really fast tempo’s will have less danceability. When testing the changes in energy and danceability in music over the decades, I found something interesting.
As you can see, the values for each decade are very similar amongst both danceability and energy. A constant rise from 1950-1970 with similar fluctuations in the next decades can be seen. This being said, is there a possible link between the energy in a song and how ‘danceable’ it is?

# Acousticness of Songs in Each Decade

‘Acousticness’ deals with the likeliness that a song was created by purely acoustic means. This refers to only using voice and acoustic instruments. If a song includes synthetic sounds, such as the use of an electric guitar or auto-tuned vocals, the acousticness of the song will be significantly lower.
➔ The strongest use of acousticness in music occured in the 1950’s. As stated before, there were not many ways that artists could create synthetic sounds at that time without using an acoustic instrument. To add, there obviously was not any auto-tune used during that time.
➔ Being that rock music was most prominent during the next few decades, this drop in acousticness is very reasonable. With the addition of the electric guitar (popularized in the late 1950’s), music was louder and more synthesized, thus lowering its overall acousticness.

# Use of Lyrics in Musical Genres

➔As you can see, hip-hop has the biggest use of lyrics in it’s genre. This is to be expected as most hip-hop features rap, which is characterized by rapid, slangy lyrics.
➔Blues and jazz are two of the smallest bubbles in this visualization. This is mostly because these genres rely more on instrumentation rather than lyricism.
